                    Hello, stranger! Thank you for revisiting my blog.<br> Today I brought, up an important topic we should think about, <em><strong id="GW">Global Warming</strong></em>.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have you ever thought about how many aspects of nature and human life have been changed in bad ways? It's uncountable. Every year, every part of the world has suffered from global warming, which is getting worse. For example, rising temperatures, melting ice leading to higher sea levels, corruption of the ecosystem, etc. In addition, according to CCAC, the climate getting warmer finally raises the possibility of having diseases and illnesses(Climate and Clean Air Coalition, <i>Why we need to act now.</i>). It means that not only nature but also we are not safe from global warming. This is why we have to think about this topic seriously.
